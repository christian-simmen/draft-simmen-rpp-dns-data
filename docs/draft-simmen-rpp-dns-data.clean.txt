    DNS data mapping for use in RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP)
                      draft-simmen-rpp-dns-data-00

Abstract

   This document proposes an RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) mapping
   for the provisioning of various DNS data.  Specified in JSON, the
   mapping is decibes common DNS record types used for domain
   provisioning as well as giving advice on how to adopt future record
   types.

1.  Introduction

   In EPP host objects [RFC5732] are introduced.  In the context of
   domain name service provisioning those objects are used as delegation
   information (NS) with optional GLUE (A) records.  By the time of
   writing new transport protocols are used for DNS like DNS over HTTPS
   [RFC8484] or DNS over QUIC [RFC9250].  Along with this development
   the need for more fine grained delegation information is emerging.
   The DELEG record type [I-D.draft-ietf-deleg] can be seen as an
   example.  Apart from plain delegation information other DNS related
   data like DNSSEC information is common to be provisioned through EPP
   [RFC5910].

1.1.  Domain Names in DNS

   DNS domain names are hierachically ordered label separated by a dot
   ".".  Each label may represent the delegation of a subordinate
   namespace or a host name.  DNS resource records [RFC1035] are
   expressed as a dataset containing:

   "NAME" "CLASS" "TYPE" "TTL" "RDATA"

   A set of resource records describes the behavior of namespace.

1.1.1.  NAME

   A server MUST NOT accept a NAME which is not a subordinate label to
   the provisioned domain name or "@" representing the provisioned
   domain itself.

1.1.2.  CLASS

   A client SHOULD omit the CLASS.  The server MUST assume "IN" as CLASS
   of a transferred dataset an MAY decline other values.

1.1.3.  TYPE

   The TYPE of data present in the RDATA.  This also implies the
   expected fields in RDATA.

1.1.4.  TTL

   A server MUST set a default value as TTL and MAY decline other
   values.  A client MAY omit this value.

1.1.5.  RDATA

   The RDATA structure depends on the TYPE and MUST be expressed as a
   JSON object.  Property names MUST follow the definition of the RDATA
   described by the coresponding RFC.

1.2.  JSON mapping

1.2.1.  Domain delegation

   To enable domain delegation a server MUST support the "NS", "A" and
   "AAAA" record types ([RFC1035],[RFC3596]).

   A minimal delegation can be expressed by adding an array of
   nameservers to the dns data of a domain:

   TODO Discuss naming "nsdname" vs. "host" vs "nameserver"

       {
         "domain": "example.com",
         "dns": [
           {
             "name": "@",
             "type": "NS",
             "rdata": {
               "nsdname": "a.iana-servers.net."
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "@",
             "type": "NS",
             "rdata": {
               "nsdname": "b.iana-servers.net."
             }
           }
         ]
       }

   If GLUE records are needed the client may add records of type "A" or
   "AAAA" :

       {
         "domain": "example.com",
         "dns": [
           {
             "name": "@",
             "type": "NS",
             "rdata": {
               "nsdname": "a.iana-servers.net."
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "@",
             "type": "NS",
             "rdata": {
               "nsdname": "ns.example.com"
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "ns.example.com",
             "type": "A",
             "rdata": {
               "address": "1.2.3.4"
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "ns.example.com",
             "type": "AAAA",
             "rdata": {
               "address": "dead::beef"
             }
           }
         ]
       }

1.2.2.  DNSSEC

   To enable DNSSEC provisioning a server SHOULD support either "DS" or
   "DNSKEY" or both record types.  The records MUST be added to the
   "dns" array of the domain

    {
      "domain": "example.com",
      "dns": [
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "NS",
          "rdata": {
            "nsdname": "a.iana-servers.net."
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "NS",
          "rdata": {
            "nsdname": "b.iana-servers.net."
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "DS",
          "rdata": {
            "key_tag": "370",
            "algorithm": 13,
            "digest_type": 2,
            "digest": "BE74359954660069D5C63D200C39F5603827D7DD02B56F120EE9F3A86764247C"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    {
      "domain": "example.com",
      "dns": [
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "NS",
          "rdata": {
            "nsdname": "a.iana-servers.net."
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "NS",
          "rdata": {
            "nsdname": "b.iana-servers.net."
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "DNSKEY",
          "rdata": {
            "flags": 257,
            "protocol": 3,
            "algorithm": 13,
            "public_key": "kXKkvWU3vGYfTJGl3qBd4qhiWp5aRs7YtkCJxD2d+t7KXqwahww5IgJtxJT2yFItlggazyfXqJEVOmMJ3qT0tQ=="
          }
        }
      ]
    }

1.2.3.  Other DNS data

   A server MAY support additional RR types, e.g. to support delegation-
   less provisioning.

   {
     "domain": "example.com",
     "dns": [
       {
         "name": "@",
         "type": "A",
         "rdata": {
           "address": "1.2.3.4"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "www.example.com",
         "type": "A",
         "rdata": {
           "address": "1.2.3.4"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "@",
         "type": "AAAA",
         "rdata": {
           "address": "dead::beef"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "www.example.com",
         "type": "A",
         "rdata": {
           "address": "dead::beef"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "@",
         "type": "MX",
         "rdata": {
           "preference": "10",
           "exchange": "mx1.example.com"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "mx1.example.com",
         "type": "A",
         "rdata": {
           "address": "5.6.7.8"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "@",
         "type": "MX",
         "rdata": {
           "preference": "20",
           "exchange": "mx2.example.net"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "@",
         "type": "TXT",
         "rdata": {
           "txt_data": "v=spf1 -all"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

   TODO Discuss enforcement of FQDN in "name", "nsdname" and "exchange"

1.2.4.  Future DNS record types

   Future record types may be added in the same way

1.3.  Signaling supported record types

   The server MUST provide a list of supported record types to the
   client.

   TODO Add signaling to general signaling of server capabilities

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   A server SHOULD choose the supported record types wisely and MAY
   restrict the number of accepted entries.  Also see security
   considerations of [RFC4627].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
