                  Provisioning of DNS data through RPP
                      draft-simmen-rpp-dns-data-00

Abstract

   This document proposes an RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) mapping
   for the provisioning of various DNS data.  Specified in JSON, the
   mapping is decibes common DNS record types used for domain
   provisioning as well as giving advice on how to adopt future record
   types.

1.  Introduction

   In EPP host objects [RFC5732] are introduced.  In the context of
   domain name service provisioning those objects are used as delegation
   information (NS) with optional GLUE (A) records.  By the time of
   writing new transport protocols are used for DNS like DNS over HTTPS
   [RFC8484] or DNS over QUIC [RFC9250].  Along with this development
   the need for more fine grained delegation information is emerging.
   The DELEG record type [I-D.draft-ietf-deleg] can be seen as an
   example.  Apart from plain delegation information other DNS related
   data like DNSSEC [RFC5910] information is common to be provisioned
   through EPP.

1.1.  Domain Names in DNS

   DNS domain names are hierachically ordered label separated by a dot
   ".".  Each label may represent the delegation of a subordinate
   namespace or a host name.  DNS resource records [RFC1035] are
   expressed as a dataset containing:

   "NAME" "CLASS" "TYPE" "TTL" "RDATA"

   A set of resource records describes the behavior of namespace.

1.1.1.  NAME

   A server MUST only accept a NAME which is a subordinate label to the
   provisioned domain name or "@" representing the provisioned domain
   itself.

1.1.2.  CLASS

   A client SHOULD omit the CLASS.  The server MUST assume "IN" as CLASS
   of a transferred dataset an MAY decline other values.

1.1.3.  TYPE

   The TYPE of data present in the RDATA.  This also implies the
   expected fields in RDATA.

1.1.4.  TTL

   A server MUST set a default value as TTL and MAY decline other
   values.  A client MAY omit this value.

1.1.5.  RDATA

   The RDATA depends on the TYPE.  A RR of TYPE "NS" has the hostname of
   an authorative nameserver.  A RR of TYPE "AAAA" holds the IPv6
   address of a host.  A RR of TYPE "DS" has multiple fields (key tag,
   key algorithm, the digest hash type and the digest hash)

1.2.  JSON mapping

   A minimal delegation can be expressed by adding an array of
   nameservers to dns data of a domain:

   { domain: "example.com" "dns": [ {"name": "@", "type": "NS", "rdata":
   {"host": "ns1.example.net"}}, {"name": "@", "type": "NS", "rdata":
   {"host": "ns2.example.net"}} ] }

   If GLUE records are needed the client may add these records:

   { domain: "example.com" "dns": [ {"name": "@", "type": "NS", "rdata":
   {"host": "ns1.example.net"}}, {"name": "@", "type": "NS", "rdata":
   {"host": "ns2.example.com"}}, {"name": "ns2.example.com", "type":
   "A", "rdata": {"address": "1.2.3.4"}}, {"name": "ns2.example.com",
   "type": "AAAA", "rdata": {"address": "dead::beef"}} ] }

   The provisioning of DNSSEC further extends the structure:

   { domain: "example.com" "dns": [ {"name": "@", "type": "NS", "rdata":
   {"host": "ns1.example.net"}}, {"name": "@", "type": "NS", "rdata":
   {"host": "ns2.example.com"}}, {"name": "ns2.example.com", "type":
   "A", "rdata": {"address": "1.2.3.4"}}, {"name": "ns2.example.com",
   "type": "AAAA", "rdata": {"address": "dead::beef"}}, {"name": "@",
   "type": "DS", "rdata": { "key_tag": "1234", "key_algorithm": 13,
   "digest_hash_type": 2, "digest_hash":
   "F341357809A5954311CCB82ADE114C6C1D724A75C0395137AA397803 5425E78D" }
   } ] }

1.2.1.  Well known RR types

1.2.2.  Future DNS record types

1.3.  Signaling supported record types

   A server MUST support the "NS", "A" and "AAAA" record type.  A server
   SHOULD support "DS" record type.  Additional record types MAY be
   supported by a server.  The server MUST provide which record types
   are supported.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
